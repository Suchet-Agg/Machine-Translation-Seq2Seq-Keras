&quot; The potential productivity gains should be considerable .
Today , QuarkXPress ® 8 has tighter integration with Photoshop ® and Illustrator ® than ever before , and through standards like HTML and CSS , QuarkXPress users can publish across media both independently and alongside Adobe ® Creative Suite ® applications like Adobe Flash ® ( SWF ) and Adobe Dreamweaver ® .
Here , you ’ ll find out how Creative Suite users can get the best possible interaction with QuarkXPress .
You ’ ll be surprised how easy Quark has made it to unlock the full potential of all your design software .
QuarkXPress 8 is considered by many to have the best integration with Photoshop ’ s PSD file format of any layout tool available today .
In this section we ’ ll explain when you should use the PSD format for your images and how to get the most out of them .
For example , you may have multiple layers in your PSD with different product shots , which will vary from publication to publication .
If you use PSD , you can switch those layers on or off in QuarkXPress without having to save a separate TIFF for each publication .
Another question that might tip you in favor of PSD is , &quot; Do I need to use a spot color with this image ?
&quot; Using spot colors in most image formats is often complicated .
However , because of the way QuarkXPress supports PSD channels , it ’ s simpler and more flexible .
Bringing the PSD files into QuarkXPress is the same as any other image . Create a Box and then use File &gt; Import ... or simply drag and drop the image from your desktop , Finder or an application like Adobe Bridge ® with or without creating a box first .
To access the special features of PSD , open the PSD Import palette . ( Window &gt; PSD Import ) You ’ ll instantly see thumbnails of the layers along with their names .
For example , you ’ ve created a layer in Photoshop to give your image an antiqued look , but when you put it in your layout it seems swamped by the surrounding colors . One option might be to reduce the opacity of that layer by clicking on it and entering a new opacity level .
If you want to add an extra ink or plate to your images , you can set up a channel to do that in Photoshop . For example , maybe you intend to varnish part of an image , or you want to use a spot color within your image .
QuarkXPress can re ­ map any channel right in the PSD Import palette — non ­ destructively .
So click on the channels divider of the PSD Import Palette ; double click on the channel in question , and you can pick any color from your project ’ s color palette , ensuring consistency .
As powerful as the PSD support of QuarkXPress 8 is , it can ’ t manipulate certain kinds of layers , such as layer effects &#91; e.g.
If you use one of these layers , the image will import and print just fine , but you won ’ t get access to the layer controls of the PSD Import palette .
If you need that functionality , you can eliminate those kinds of layers from your PSD by converting the layer effects to stand ##AT##-##AT## alone layers or &apos; smart objects &apos; &#91; right click on the Layer in the Photoshop layers palette &#93; .
QuarkXPress supports text layers , most adjustment layers , and even 3D layers including opacity and blending mode controls .
Illustrator is a great tool for creating logos and vector illustrations .
Traditionally , the route into QuarkXPress has been to export an EPS from Illustrator .
Now , things are made much easier with the arrival of direct Illustrator .ai file import into QuarkXPress 8 .
Simply drag and drop or import your Illustrator native file into your layout just as you would any graphics file format .
QuarkXPress has a powerful transparency engine , but it doesn ’ t support partially transparent objects in PDF or .ai files yet .
So if you are using something like a drop shadow in Illustrator and plan to place that over a non ##AT##-##AT## white background or object , you might see undesirable results .
The good news is that the drop shadow and transparency features of QuarkXPress works on imported Illustrator files , so you can apply a drop shadow or change the opacity of your .ai file right in your layout instead .
QuarkXPress is well equipped for drawing tasks and in our newest release we have standardised many of our graphics tools to work more like Illustrator , Freehand and similar tools .

Barbecue and Mate Tea are Argentinian inventions with a social function .
Many Argentinian families have in their own grill in the backyard of their homes ( called parrillas ) , where they meet on the weekends for a meal together with friends and relatives .
The beef here has different cuts to that of Europe .
The &quot; baby bife &quot; is approximately 1 / 2kg of steak , which could nourish a whole family .
The &quot; bife de chorizo &quot; is a gigantic rump steak , the &quot; bife de lomo &quot; a filet .
&quot; Asado de tira &quot; is the part of the ribs , the &quot; bife de costilla &quot; is a T ##AT##-##AT## bone Steak , the &quot; matambre &quot; is a very thin cut piece of meat with lots of fat .
Like in Europe , meat is prepared rare , mid rare , done , well done etc .
The sauce which comes with the meat dish is called &quot; chimichurri &quot; . However , because of the excellent taste of the meat , it can well be eaten without sauce .
A full plate of mixed grill contains practically all animal innards from various animals .
The Sausage ( chorizo ) and the black pudding ( morcilla ) are very popular .
Served with the meats are vegetables ( sweet potatoes , pumpkin puree ) and mixed salads .
In a restaurant it is of course possible to order other parts of meats .
Depending on the season and region , it is possible to eat in Argentina very good food and meat such as deer , lamb , sheep , goat , fish , and other seafood .
Special delicacies are : king prawns ( centolla ) from Tierra de Fuego and wild boar ( jabalí ) or trout in Bariloche .
Special dishes , going back as far as colonial times are : &quot; pastel de choclo &quot; or the &quot; humita &quot; .
More typical are chicken &quot; pollo &quot; in its most varied prepartions , &quot; milanesa &quot; ( Viennese escalope ) , &quot; empanadas &quot; ( fried pastry shells filled with chopped beef , chicken , maize or cheese and ham ) or &quot; choripan &quot; similar to a Hot Dog .
Many Italian restaurants are found here which serve pizza and pasta .
Next to fresh fruit salads and good ice cream , a wide range of desserts are offered .
Two Argentine specialities are the &quot; dulce de leche &quot; , milk ##AT##-##AT## caramel marmalade which is also used to as a bread spread and the &quot; alfajores &quot; ( small cake ##AT##-##AT## formed biscuits with different fillings ) .
